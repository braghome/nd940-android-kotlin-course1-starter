    <string name="oxford_text">An Oxford shoe is characterized by shoelace eyelets tabs that are attached under the vamp,[1] a feature termed \"closed lacing\".[2] This contrasts with Derbys, or bluchers, which have shoelace eyelets attached to the top of the vamp.[3] Originally, Oxfords were plain, formal shoes, made of leather, but they evolved into a range of styles suitable for formal, uniform, or casual wear. On the basis of function and the dictates of fashion, Oxfords are now made from a variety of materials, including calf leather, faux and genuine patent leather, suede, and canvas. They are normally black or brown, and may be plain or patterned (brogue).</string>
